# Godot Clipper module

## Work in progress!

This is a wrapper for the popular polygon clipping library originally written by
Angus Johnson: [Clipper](https://sourceforge.net/projects/polyclipping/)

Currently has no useful methods wrapped yet, sorry! Consider contributing?

## Notice

This is not Clipper 6.4.2!

The code is taken from [Clipper2](https://sourceforge.net/p/polyclipping/code/HEAD/tree/sandbox/Clipper2/)
sandbox (currently beta), which adds additional support for robust polygon triangulation.
